The intention of the functions in this file is to first count the number of possible and observed k-mers within a given string of possible characters (which are defined as "A, C, G, T" for the purpose of this test.) It is then possible to calculate the overall linguistic complexity of a string of characters from the combination (and respective division) of the observed k-mers and the possible k-mers. 

A data frame containing these possible an observed values with the relevant totals is also produced from this test.
